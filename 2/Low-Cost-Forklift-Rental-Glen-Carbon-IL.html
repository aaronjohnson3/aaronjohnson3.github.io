Double-Deep trucks are similar, but with longer forks, making them perfect for areas where multiple pallet loads are stored in each bay as they will reach right to the back of the bay.</p>

Like the base model 3-wheel forklift, the basic 4-wheel capacity is 3,000 lb. But the difference between the two types of trucks is that 4-wheels don't quite have the maneuverability of 3-wheels.</p>
<p>United Rentals is an Authorized Dealer for Motorola and can provide a variety of handheld and portable radio solutions. These manual pallet jacks are ideal for special applications. However, for a warehouse with narrow aisles, having a maneuverable forklift capable of reaching in excess of ten meters makes the reach truck a considerable adversary in the right conditions.</p>

For Xtreme, limiting the turning radius of the machines is a focus, and the three larger models have an outside turning radius of 13 feet 7 inches. ICE forklifts can handle loads of up to 15,500 pounds and are ideal for indoor operation on smooth floors.

<p>Simply pick up the mobile unit with any kind of forklift or truck and drive wherever you need to go. Top-notch customer service and trustworthy equipmentâ€”that's why Atlas is one of the leading Toyota forklift dealers in the Chicago, IL area. Simple does not mean you should try to install this kind of lift kit yourself, however, unless you have a lot of experience with working on truck frames and bodies and the right equipment to do it safely.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that there are no set rules for exactly how much a used forklift should price, and a whole lot will also depend on the demand and supply of used forklifts in your town. Generally speaking the reach truck will be less expensive new, used or leased than a sit-down forklift but the real value is in increased warehouse productivity. At United Equipment, we offer a wide range of Cat and Elevah order pickers for sale, the ideal pickers for high, narrow or tricky-to-navigate spaces.</p>
