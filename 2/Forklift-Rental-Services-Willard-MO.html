Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope.

Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
