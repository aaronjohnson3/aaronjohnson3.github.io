<p>A forklift is also known as a lift truck essentially because it's a truck that can lift loads using a set of forks. Begin your inspection facing the front of the forklift. Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>Popular types are high-lift fork truck, high-lift ram truck, high-lift boom truck, high-lift clamp truck, and high-lift platform truck (Fig. ATTACHMENT: A device other than conventional forks or load backrest extension, mounted permanently or removably on the elevating mechanism of a truck for handling the load.
