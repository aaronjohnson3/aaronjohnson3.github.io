<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. The Pivot Steer Forklift Truck is commonly used in industry both inside of a warehouse and is ideal for very narrow aisle work as the mast can be rotated 90° to either side of the truck. It keeps some of the ride characteristics you love from the factory Jeep Wrangler spring while improving the off-road performance. We have an expansive inventory of pre-owned forklifts from Hyster, Taylor, Yale, Toyota, Caterpillar, Hoist, Kalmar, TCM and other leading brands.</p>
<p>Pro Comp offers a selection of lift kits for almost every major make and model truck or suv.

From new and used forklifts and compact construction equipment to rentals, repairs, and parts, we're your complete quality experts.</p>

However, in both cases, these vehicles have to be operated by a person who can either sit or stand while operating the forklift.</p>
