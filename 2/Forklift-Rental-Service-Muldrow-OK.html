<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>

Turret trucks or Swing-Reach® can work in aisles as narrow as 60”, and are used for placing and retrieving pallets in warehouse rack at elevated heights.</p>

<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
<p>Top models are equipped with features that include robust transmissions geared for quick directional changes, custom tires that provide enhanced traction on loose, rocky terrain, and two- or four-wheel operation for safe, effective navigation.
