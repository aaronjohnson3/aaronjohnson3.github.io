Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks. The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>Well, one of the simplest ways to make a truck stand out is integrating a body lift kit or suspension lift kit. You can rent top-quality and expertly-maintained equipment at United Rentals.

<p>Suspension lifts are also found on a number of high performance sports cars, in which a very low ground clearance is used to improve handling, using an aerodynamic effect known as downforce; examples include the Ferrari 488, Lamborghini Huracan, McLaren 720S, and the second generation Ford GT. Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope.
