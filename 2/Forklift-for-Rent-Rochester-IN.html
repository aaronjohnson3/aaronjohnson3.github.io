Today, forklift trucks facilitate work of thousands of people, especially in manufacturing and warehousing sectors.

<p>Aside from these two distinct types of a forklift, there are many other varieties available. Reach forklifts, also known as reach trucks, get their names from the distinctive way in which their fork carriages can ‘reach' into racking.
