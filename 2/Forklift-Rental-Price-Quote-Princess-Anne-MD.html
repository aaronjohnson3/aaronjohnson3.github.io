Riding or giving rides on forklift or load. If you transport large quantities of goods and heavy loads across short distances on a daily basis, you will soon reap the benefits of using our manual hand pallet trucks.</p>

It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead.
