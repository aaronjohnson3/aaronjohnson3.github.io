Infinitely variable lift and lower control provides smooth control for precise platform work. Unlike Standard Counterbalance and Reach Forklifts, These forklifts are steered via the front swivel articulation of the forklift and are therefore much different to manoeuvre than regular forklifts and additionally have no pantograph feature for retrieving stock in narrow aisles.</p>

Mitsubishi counterbalance forklifts are designed for exceptional comfort and increased productivity - from beginning of the shift to the end. Some order pickers are in a climate-controlled environment, while others work in sub-freezing temperatures.
