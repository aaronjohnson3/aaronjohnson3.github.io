<h2>Industrial Lift Truck & Equipment Trenton </h2>
<p>Speak to our representatives about finding the right lift truck and rental plan for your application.

<h2>For Lift Truck Trenton</h2>
<p>Body lift kits work to lift the body of the vehicle but continues to keep the chassis and suspension at the same height in relation to the ground. This is a unique walkie counterbalance truck which was designed to operate in a large chemical manufacturing facility. At the end of the day, lifting your truck can help you improve its look and performance, but you need to be confident in the work being done and the folks who are doing it. Even if that's not you, be honest.</p>
<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines. When altering a truck's suspension to make it higher, the vehicle's frame and body is moved up and away from the differentials. The redesign includes modifying the forklift chain and the mast inner channel to create a wider window creating better visibility. The lift trucks are used to unload, lift, lower and stack pallet loads, or other bulk loads into storage and transportation racks and facilities.</p>
<p>Provides references that may aid in recognizing hazards associated with powered industrial trucks and provides examples of possible solutions. If you see yourself going on frequent off-road adventures, a suspension lift will be beneficial. In order to be able to pick up heavy loads at the front, a forklift has to be even heavier at the back. They have over 60 years of experience in equipment rental.</p>
