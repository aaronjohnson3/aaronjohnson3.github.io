<h3>Small Reach Forklift Van Alstyne TX</h3>
<p>Considerations include forklift type, capacity, carriage type, and number of hydraulic functions (that power the attachment features).

A typical lift truck uses two power-operated horizontal prongs (forks) that can be raised and lowered for loading, transporting, and unloading goods, particularly goods stacked on wooden pallets.</p>
<p>It is best to replace them in pairs to maintain an even ride height from side-to-side. Standing forklifts are also typically easier to move around and maneuver around corners and in tight spaces.
