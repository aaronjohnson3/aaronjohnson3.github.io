<p>Scenario: You're in the market for a new forklift in Indianapolis You know specifically that you need an electric lift truck with cushion tires that can lift loads up to 4,500 lbs. In 2018, the Chinese market maintained rapid growth, with the fork sales outnumbering 500,000 units in the first ten months of 2018 and expectedly approaching 600,000 units throughout the year. Loop handle is spring loaded to return to upright position and eliminate bending to retrieve. Use our IC to Electric calculator to see what your potential cost savings could be by switching to electric forklifts.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly. For example, a sit-down, counterbalanced high-lift rider truck is more likely than a motorized hand truck to be involved in a falling load accident because the sit-down rider truck can lift a load much higher than a hand truck. The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>

In our inventory you can explore a variety of new and used electric, internal combustion, and rough terrain forklifts, as well as a number of boom lifts and floor cleaners.</p>

The user should mark, on the sides of the truck, in letters at least 1½ in. high, the actual vehicle weight, the maximum load and the combined weight of the vehicle and capacity load. The 35 Construction Teletruk counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver.</p>
