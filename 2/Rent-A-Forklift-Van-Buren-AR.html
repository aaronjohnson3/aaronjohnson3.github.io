<h3>Warehouse Forklift Van Buren AR</h3>
<p>Forklift Sales Botswana started over 15 years ago, when we took on the TOYOTA Forklift Dealer, and since then we have a current, estimated 80% share of the Botswana Forklift Market. Their rental fleet is worth around $1.5 billion. From the smallest, lightest loads in retail environments to the heaviest SKUs in the highest distribution centers, our trucks can handle any order picking application and help you get the most out of every operator, every shift, every day.</p>
<p>For example, if what you are used to is an automatic car, test driving should not be the time for you to attempt driving a stick shift vehicle. The Toyota Order Picker easily maneuvers narrow aisles in warehouses with minimized rack impact during case picking thanks to optional wire guidance and double rail guidance systems. Industrial and powered pallet jacks in general weigh more than standard light-duty models.</p>
<p>As for the right amount of lift, a 2-, 4-, or 6-inch lift kit (or more) will give you more clearance for driving off-road. We handle all major brands, makes, models, years and everything from an electric pallet jack to larger trucks. Both available in two- and four-wheel-drive, the 6,000-pound-capacity RT706J and 8,000-pound-capacity RT708J models utilize an 80-hp John Deere 4045 diesel engine.</p>
