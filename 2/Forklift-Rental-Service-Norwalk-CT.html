<p>BJ's Rentals, Inc. Here at East Midlands Forklifts , we provide comprehensive forklift training for a variety of trucks and at various levels. An overhead guard is intended to offer protection from the impact of small packages, boxes, bagged material, etc., representative of the job application, but not to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load. Two lifting-fork order pickers allow the operator to vary the load height to reduce the need for reaching and bending.</p>
<p>Discover our range of electric forklifts: designed for different purposes, all with the same world class ergonomics. Rough Terrain lifts are usually powered by internal combustion engines that require refueling.

We proudly offer Unicarrier, Hyundai, Baoli, Flexi, JLG, and Linde forklifts to meet your preference.</p>
<p>If it is only to be used for a handful of hours each week, you can safely settle for a used forklift that is ten to twelve years old, because you are likely to get another seven or eight years of useful service out of it. Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>

The baselegs and stand-up configuration of the tractor allow reach trucks to be used in aisles as narrow as 9 feet.
