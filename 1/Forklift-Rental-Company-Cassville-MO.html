<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Those same bumps and bounces that give off-road riding much of its thrill also wear out your rig's systems, especially the suspension. Maximal's New "A" Series Forklift is designed for the driver. Each type of fork lift truck has different operating procedures.
