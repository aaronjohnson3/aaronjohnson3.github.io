Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable.

The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
