<p>This description refers to the type of pallet or product the jack is able to carry. Toyota Forklifts has introduced three new order pickers. This is mainly due to the presence of the prominent players across the U.S. These players are indulged in making heavy investments in adopting the advance and modern Forklift Trucks rather than the conventional Forklift Trucks.</p>
<h2>Toyota Equipment Baker</h2>
<p>Although the test load must not be restrained in any manner that will affect the deflection of the forks or mast, or free movement of truck, as the platform is tilted, the test load should be secured against possible sliding on the forks in order to sustain an accurate load center and for safety reasons in case the truck tips past the balance point.</p>
