<p>Forklift is a powered industrial truck used to lift and move materials in warehouses and yards.

<p>In a stand-up forklift, most often they require the use of a joystick which can present a learning curve to some operators. Rough terrain forklifts have inflatable tires with thicker treads which allows it to gain stability on uneven surfaces. Some industrial reach forklift trucks have a mechanism allowing its cab to tilt, enabling the operator to have a more convenient position while viewing.</p>
<p>8 Finished forklifts are shipped to the customer or distributor by truck or by rail.
