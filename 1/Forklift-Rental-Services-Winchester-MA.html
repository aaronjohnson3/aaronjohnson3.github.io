The ZR2 has increased clearance, a transfer case shield, front frame-mounted tow hooks, and 17-inch wheels with Goodyear Wrangler DuraTrac maximum traction tires. There are different sized forklifts and you'll have to determine if you want a smaller or bigger sized equipment to handle all of the lifting.</p>
<p>You can set them up with work-saver forks (roughly about 9” wide), and they lift pallets some few inches from the ground. Never try to stop a pallet jack with hands or feet, this could cause serious injury, especially with a very heavy load. There are some specialty trucks that are used in specific industries or in certain settings, such as a sideloader that picks up and carries pallets to the side of the vehicle instead of in the front.</p>

While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
