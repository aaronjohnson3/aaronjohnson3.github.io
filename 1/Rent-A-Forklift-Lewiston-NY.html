Take a test drive of a lifted GMC truck at our GMC dealership's headquarters as soon as you can. We take pride in offering one of the largest, most up-to-date rental fleets of lift trucks including cushion tire, heavy lift, electric and pick loader lift trucks across Alabama and Northwest Florida. Since electric forklifts use a battery, there are no fuel costs; they operate a great deal more quietly than internal combustion engines and last longer than internal combustion engines because they have less moving parts.</p>
<p>France and Italy are on the upsurge of adopting the electric Forklift Trucks, which would be a key driver for the trucking industry in the region. These advanced electric forklifts are equipped with the newest generation of AC technology, assuring you industry-leading performance.
