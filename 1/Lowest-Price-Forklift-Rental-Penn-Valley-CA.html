<p>3-wheel counterbalance forklift trucks are similar to 4-wheel counterbalance machines.

Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
