This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>Crown's Smart Systems continually monitor and analyze lift truck activity to enable control of travel speed, braking, cornering speed and position hold. According to Manitou, cabs feature efficient heating and ventilation as standard, air conditioning (optional).” The company uses Shock Absorber Technology” designed to keeps the load stable in all types of terrain.</p>
