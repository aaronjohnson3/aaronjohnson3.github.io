The best lift kits have fairly new if not brand new arched springs with suitable length to prevent odd shackle angles. The TAWI Mobile Order Picker is a one-of-a-kind solution for mobile material handling and order picking from pallet racks. A lifted truck is a truck that has had its suspension altered to increase the height of the vehicle, and sometimes fitted with large wheels.</p>
