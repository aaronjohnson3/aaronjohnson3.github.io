<h2>Importance Of Material Handling Equipment And Engine Hoist Bartlett </h2>
<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>
<p>So that your handling capacity stays high under all circumstances, Linde Material Handling offers a large selection of particularly agile pallet trucks. This allows our electric reach trucks to transport loads weighing up to 2.5 tons quickly and safely to their destination.

Counterbalance forklifts are one of the most popular types of powered industrial trucks used today, and the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires counterbalance forklift training for any operator using this type of lift.

The most basic piece of material handling equipment is the hand pallet truck. Saddle Trucks: Saddle trucks also have long forks but they have the ability to grip onto the edges of the load for increase stability. The only difference is a slightly heavier counterweight that gives the extra 500 lb. capacity to the truck.</p>

Exceptionally strong body for handling with ease, large uneven loads up to 5 tons.
