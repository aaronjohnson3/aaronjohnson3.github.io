<p>Forklifts can actually be traced back to the late 1800's, but the modern forklift was developed in the 1960s by various companies including the transmission manufacturing company Clark and the hoist company Yale & Towne Manufacturing. This counterbalance (whether it's an actual weight or the forklift batteries found in an electric lift) is what offsets the load in front, accommodating weights from 3,000 to 120,000 lbs depending on the model selected.</p>

According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>
