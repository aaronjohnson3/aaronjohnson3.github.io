Therefore, a truck's suspension has to be lifted and its components adjusted so everything fits and works well. This is an efficient way of picking less-than-pallet-load shipments and is popular for use in large distribution centers.</p>
<p>It is designed to lift heavier loads higher in a compact footprint with improved speed and energy efficiency. We are largest supplier and importer of Electric High Lift Pallet Truck. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are the forklifts that do most of the materials handling work in industrial facilities today.
