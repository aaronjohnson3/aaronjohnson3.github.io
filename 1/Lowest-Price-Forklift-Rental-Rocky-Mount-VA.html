<p>Much more significant than any of the other forklift classes, class 7s are almost exclusively used outdoors to carry the most substantial materials to the loading docks or storage. At the same time, reach trucks offer very high acceleration as well as impressive lift and reach speeds, which in turn ensures excellent throughput performance. There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>
<p>However, just like a stock vehicle, some components in a lift kit can wear out over time, most notably the shock absorbers Some lift kits include shocks that are radically different from the stock units, meaning that replacing those shocks isn't always as simple as just looking your vehicle up. In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>

<p>In addition, alternate rated capacities may be established at other load centers and other platform heights. It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>
<p>Place empty truck on an initially level platform in a position such that a line connecting the center of either load wheel tire (or outermost tire where multiple tires are used) and the projection perpendicular to the platform of the point of intersection of the longitudinal centerline of the truck and the centerline of the steering wheels is parallel to the axis of tilting of the platform.</p>
